      <h1>2020 ELECTION LITIGATION (PART 10): LESSONS LEARNED</h1>
      <p><i>I reflect on the post-election litigation season and distill two lessons.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | December 22, 2020</b></p>
      <p>This is the tenth and final 2020 Election Litigation installment. In this series, I have chronicled the Trump Campaign&rsquo;s post-election lawsuits. Up to this point, my primary focus has been simply to accurately relay the information in notable court filings. Acknowledging the uncharted waters into which the lawsuits waded, I sought to limit any analysis of the lawsuits to the relative intra-lawsuit strength of the arguments made. Consequently, I have attempted to avoid making any predictions about the litigation.</p>
      <p>Here, I will reflect on the post-election litigation tidal wave that has flooded courtrooms, and outline the two biggest lessons I learned from these lawsuits.</p>
      <h2>Lesson 1: State Court is a Preferable Venue</h2>
      <p>From the very beginning of this series, I noted the reluctance of Federal courts to intervene in elections contests, particularly when a remedy exists under State law.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ffn1">1</a></sup> Federal courts were still reluctant to intervene this election cycle, but for different, largely procedural, reasons separate from the existence of sufficient State procedures. Indeed, the procedural nature of the case disposition highlights the difficulty in even getting to a merits decision in Federal court.</p>
      <p>State court seems like a better option for post-election litigation. The reason is rooted in the respective jurisdiction of each court system for two main reasons.</p>
      <p><i>A. Concurrent Jurisdiction</i></p>
      <p>State courts have concurrent jurisdiction with Federal courts over questions of Federal law.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ffn2">2</a></sup> However, the inverse is not true; Federal courts generally lack authority to decide cases arising exclusively under State law.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ffn3">3</a></sup> Add to this the fact that most States have statutes permitting candidates to contest an election.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ffn4">4</a></sup> Therefore, to choose Federal court over State court, in this context, artificially limits the types of claims one can bring. Such a choice may also artificially close the courthouse door, since these State election contest statutes may provide an independent basis for jurisdiction.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ffn5">5</a></sup></p>
      <p><i>B. Filing in State Court Does Not Preclude United States Supreme Court Review</i></p>
      <p>Simply because a plaintiff may choose to initially file an election contest in State court does not mean he or she will not be able to ultimately end up before the United States Supreme Court. Congress has given the Supreme Court jurisdiction to review &ldquo;[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had.&rdquo; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201128193326/https:/www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1257">28 U.S.C. § 1257(a)</a>.</p>
      <p>There is a bit of a catch, however. The &ldquo;final judgment or decree&rdquo; of a State high court usually must entail some aspect of Federal law for the Supreme Court to take up the case. In the election context, the Federal law component will usually be the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or both. If <i>Bush v. Gore</i> is any indication, then the Equal Protection Clause might provide a useful tool in post-election cases taking issue with how certain votes are counted.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ffn6">6</a></sup></p>
      <p>There is a small caveat to the catch. Brining a claim in State court may also prove to be beneficial, because the State courts themselves may provide a separate basis for Federal jurisdiction, should appeal to the Supreme Court be pursued. This was partially on display in <i>Bush v. Gore</i>, which ruled the decision of the Florida supreme court itself violated the Equal Protection Clause, because it altered the standards to be used in manual recounts.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ffn7">7</a></sup></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
      <p>Based on the foregoing, State court seems to be the preferable venue for filing post-election lawsuits.</p>
      <h2>Lesson 2: Laches, Laches, Laches</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest things I personally took away from covering these post-election lawsuits was how much of a factor the doctrine of laches plays in election law.</p>
      <p>Laches is an equitable defense that functions like a statute of limitations. The Supreme Court has described &ldquo;a uniform principle&rdquo; that &ldquo;pervades . . . all&rdquo; laches cases:</p>
        <blockquote>They proceed on the assumption that the party to whom laches is imputed has knowledge of his rights, and an ample opportunity to establish them in the proper forum; that by reason of his delay the adverse party has good reason to believe that the alleged rights are worthless, or have been abandoned; and that because of the change in condition or relations during this period of delay, it would be an injustice to the latter to permit him to now assert them.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ffn8">8</a></sup></blockquote>
      <p>A successful laches defense, according to the Supreme Court, &ldquo;requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ffn9">9</a></sup></p>
      <p>Laches&rsquo;s place in election law is intuitive, especially in light of the fact that elections operate on relatively predictable timetables.</p>
      <p>During the 2012 Republican Primary, for example, four candidates did not obtain the 10,000 valid petition signatures required to have their names placed on the Virginia ballot by the deadline.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ffn10">10</a></sup> The candidates officially filed their Federal Election Commission Statement of Candidacy between May and August of 2011.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ffn11">11</a></sup> The filing deadline to submit petition signatures in Virginia was December 22, 2011.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ffn12">12</a></sup> On the filing deadline, two of the candidate plaintiffs submitted petitions containing less than 10,000 signatures; one candidate submitted petitions containing 11,050 signatures, less than 10,000 of which the Virginia Board of Elections (VBOE) determined to be valid; and one candidate simply did not submit any signatures.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ffn13">13</a></sup> The VBOE determined that two of the candidates did not qualify for inclusion onto the primary ballot.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ffn14">14</a></sup> Republican Party Chairman Pat Mullins announced that the two other candidates did not submit enough valid signatures.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ffn15">15</a></sup></p>
      <p>The candidates brought suit in Federal court on January 15, 2001, claiming the 10,000-signature requirement violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and association.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ffn16">16</a></sup> The candidates sought an injunction requiring their inclusion onto the ballots. The District Court denied the motion and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Both decisions were based on laches. The Fourth Circuit noted that the lead plaintiff &ldquo;was able to bring these constitutional challenges for over four months before the filing deadline,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ffn17">17</a></sup> and that the &ldquo;cognizable injury occurred no later than August 13, 2011, the day on which [the lead plaintiff] declared his candidacy for President.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ffn18">18</a></sup></p>
      <p>In addition to concluding that plaintiffs were not duly diligent in pursuing their claim, the court also found the timing of the suit prejudiced the defendants. Federal and State law require absentee military and overseas ballots to be mailed at least 45 days before an election.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ffn19">19</a></sup> A consent decree mandated &ldquo;full compliance with the 45-day requirement.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ffn20">20</a></sup> Since the primary election was scheduled for March 6, 2012, January 21, 2012—a mere six days after the lawsuit was filed—was the deadline for compliance.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ffn21">21</a></sup> To meet the 45-day deadline, the VBOE set a January 9, 2012, deadline for localities to &ldquo;complete the preparations for printing of ballots.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ffn22">22</a></sup> So even before the hearing in the <i>District</i> Court occurred on January 13, 2012, the VBOE had already approved the ballot proofs for almost all 134 election jurisdictions and, &ldquo;based on that approval, nearly all of the localities had already given their printers permission to print [the ballots].&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ffn23">23</a></sup> Granting the candidates&rsquo; requested relief would require exorbitant reprinting costs and potentially lead to voter confusion.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ffn24">24</a></sup></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
      <p>In most of my coverage of these lawsuits, I did not really consider how laches operates in election litigation at all. But watching these cases unfold and reading the associated case law, there can be no doubt that laches is a bedrock principle that one must keep in mind when contemplating potential election-related litigation.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The post-election litigation wave has been quite a learning experience. As a young lawyer, there were many valuable takeaways from this litigation, and lessons that I will no doubt carry forward into practice.</p>

      <p id="fn3"><sup><a href="#ffn3">3</a></sup> There is an argument, albeit a weak one, to be made that supplemental jurisdiction could be used to overcome this general prohibition by combining Federal and State law claims in Federal court.

      <p id="fn4"><sup><a href="#ffn4">4</a></sup> I use the phrase &ldquo;election contest&rdquo; to refer to different processes that may lead the initial certified result to change. These processes can include discretionary recounts, mandatory recounts, challenging compliance with State election law, etc.</p>
      <p id="fn5"><sup><a href="#ffn5">5</a></sup> Wisconsin law, for example, permits one to appeal an election contest from the county election board to the State circuit court and then ultimately to the State supreme court. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Trump v.

      <p id="fn7"><sup><a href="#ffn7">7</a></sup> <i>Id</i>. There is a less clear role that the Due Process Clause can play in post-election litigation. In Bush v. Gore, the issue of a Due Process Clause violation was raised, but the Supreme Court appears to have punted on the issue. Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. at 103. Since the Court found a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, deciding the Due Process Clause issue likely became unnecessary. One Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a Due Process Clause violation could be made out &ldquo;[i]f the election process itself reaches the point of patent and fundamental unfairness.&rdquo; Griffin v. Burns, 570 F.2d 1065, 1078 (1st Cir. 1978). Almost every other Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has adopted this reasoning. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Gold v. Feinberg, 101 F.3d 796 (2nd Cir. 1996); Marks v. Stinson, 19 F.3d 873 (3rd Cir. 1994); Hendon v. North Carolina State Board of Elections, 710 F.2d 177 (4th Cir. 1983); Duncan v. Poythress, 657 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1981); League of Women Voters v. Brunner, 548 F.3d 463 (6th Cir. 2008); Hennings v. Grafton, 523 F.2d 861 (7th Cir. 1975); National Audubon Society, Inc. v. Davis, 307 F.3d 835 (9th Cir. 2002); Roe v. Alabama, 43 F.3d 574 (11th Cir. 1995). This leaves the Eighth, Tenth, and District of Columbia Circuits as the remaining Circuits that have yet to adopt Griffin&rsquo;s reasoning. In my research, I did not find a case from any of these three Circuits explicitly rejecting the Due Process Clause analysis of Griffin.</p>
