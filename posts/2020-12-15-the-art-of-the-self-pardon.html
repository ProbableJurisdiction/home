      <h1>THE ART OF THE SELF-PARDON</h1>
      <p><i>Whether the President will, can, or should, issue a pardon to himself has been a hotly debated issue. Here, I examine some of the issue of the presidential self-pardon.</i></p>
      <p><b>MDA | December 15, 2020</b></p>
      <p>With President Donald J. Trump’s presidency apparently coming to an end, speculation has begun regarding the possible criminal exposure the President faces upon leaving the White House.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ffn1">1</a></sup> Accompanied with this speculation is public discussion regarding the scope of the Presidential pardon power, specifically whether a President may self-pardon (<i>i.e.</i>, pardon himself).<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ffn2">2</a></sup></p>
      <p>No President has issued a self-pardon before. As a result, no governing precent exists for such a pardon, in either judicial opinion or historical practice. There is also no consensus among the legal academe on the propriety of a self-pardon. This lack of consensus has bred a rich body of academic literature. Persuasive arguments are made on both sides of the issue. If called upon to decide the issue, however, I believe a court would uphold a self-pardon as Constitutional.</p>
      <p>The best place to begin with any analysis of a Constitutional provision is the text. Article II, sec. 2, cl. 1 of the United States Constitution provides, in part, “The President shall . . . have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”</p>
      <p>The enumerated exception related to “Cases of Impeachment” is instructive. One canon of textual interpretation holds that enumerated exceptions generally foreclose the existence of additional implied exceptions.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ffn3">3</a></sup></p>
      <p>While the canon of textual interpretation outlined above is a staple of <i>statutory</i> interpretation, the Supreme Court has implicitly held that the same logic applies to the pardon clause. As early as 1867, the Supreme Court explicitly said “[t]he [pardon] power thus conferred is unlimited, with the exception stated.”<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ffn4">4</a></sup> The Supreme Court solidified this sentiment over one century later, explaining in an opinion by Chief Justice Burger “that the pardoning power is an enumerated power of the Constitution and that its limitation, if any, <i>must be found in the Constitution itself</i>.”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ffn5">5</a></sup></p>
      <p>Opponents of the self-pardon argue that, while the text of the Constitution reveals no self-pardon exception, the structure of the Constitution does reveal such an exception.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ffn6">6</a></sup> Specifically, opponents point to Article I, sec. 8, cl. 7, which states, in relevant part, “the Party convicted [in the Senate of impeachable offenses] shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” (I refer to this provision as the “post-impeachment prosecution clause.”) A self-pardon, the argument goes, would nullify the purpose of this provision of ensuring accountability by preventing an otherwise inevitable prosecution.</p>
      <p>This argument fails, because the Constitution lacks textual support for such a proposition. In fact, to adopt opponents’ construction would require a court to perform interpretive gymnastics on a truly magnificent scale.</p>
      <p>For self-pardon opponents’ construction to be feasible, the post-impeachment prosecution clause would need to be interpreted as <i>requiring</i> criminal prosecution for officials impeached for conduct that is also criminal (hereinafter singularly referred to as/a “criminally impeachable” conduct/offense). This is due to the fact that there are numerous reasons—unrelated to receipt of a pardon—why an official guilty of criminally impeachable conduct would not face criminal charges before or upon removal from office: the evidence may not be strong enough to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ffn7">7</a></sup> prosecutorial discretion may counsel against brining charges for reasons other than evidentiary shortcomings (<i>e.g.</i>, seeking to heal a divided nation<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ffn8">8</a></sup>), or the Government may opt for civil penalties, rather than criminal ones, among other things.</p>
      <p>Each of these non-prosecutorial manners of disposing of a case would frustrate the asserted accountability-ensuring purpose of the post-impeachment prosecution clause.</p>
      <p>More to the point, each of these outcomes, like a pardon, also result from an exercise of purely executive discretion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, for the post-impeachment prosecution clause to truly achieve the accountability-ensuring purpose and effect self-pardon opponents claim is inherent in the clause, a court would need to interpret the clause as not only a restriction on the pardon power, but also every facet of the President’s law enforcement powers. This interpretation would not only work a restriction on the impeached President, but also on the successor of the impeached President. Accountability could not be ensured, after all, if the impeached President’s successor could derail any post-impeachment prosecution via executive action, especially since the successor President would be a member of the same political party as the impeached President.</p>
      <p>With respect to the pardon specifically, there is no articulable principle for why the post-impeachment prosecution clause should only proscribe a self-pardon. Indeed, the reasons why self-pardon opponents claim the clause prohibits a self-pardon apply with equal force to a pardon granted to any official guilty of criminally impeachable conduct.</p>
      <p>The above demonstrates how much would have to be <i>read into</i> the post-impeachment prosecution clause for the clause to be applied in a principled manner. It is unlikely that any federal appellate court would adopt self-pardon opponents’ interpretation based on this fact alone.</p>
      <p>The other major hurdle self-pardon opponents face is the plain text of the post-impeachment clause, which does not support either the underlying proposition related to a self-pardon or any of the implicatory necessities that would result from self-pardon opponents’ interpretation.</p>
      <p>While the verb “shall” is typically “used in laws, regulations, or directives to express what is mandatory,”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ffn9">9</a></sup> the object of the mandate in the post-impeachment prosecution clause is merely that the impeached official be “<i>liable and subject to</i>”<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ffn10">10</a></sup> post-impeachment prosecution.</p>
      <p>“Liable” and “subject to” are not words and phrases expressing certainty or inevitability. “Liable” relevantly means “exposed or subject to some usually adverse contingency or action.”<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ffn11">11</a></sup> “Subject to,” as relevant here, is defined as “affected by or possibly affected by (something).”<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ffn12">12</a></sup></p>
      <p>Indeed, the post-impeachment prosecution clause would not make any sense if prosecution was mandated. This is because the relationship between impeachable offenses and criminal offenses is properly conceptualized as a Venn diagram. <i>Some</i> criminal offenses are also impeachable offenses and vice-a-versa (<i>e.g.</i>, treason and bribery<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ffn13">13</a></sup>). But not <i>all</i> criminal offenses are impeachable offenses, and not <i>all</i> impeachable offenses are criminal offenses. It would make no sense for the Framers to have mandated prosecution for impeachable offenses that violated no criminal statute.</p>
      <p>While the text offers no refuge for self-pardon opponents’ arguments, other areas of consideration are whether the debates at the Constitutional Convention or historical practice establish that a self-pardon is unconstitutional. If the evidence on either of these points is strong, then it can potentially overcome some of the textual hurdles opponents face.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ffn14">14</a></sup> Unfortunately, neither point offers any such refuge.</p>
      <p>The record of the debates at the Constitutional Convention reveal discussion regarding only to which Branch of Government the pardon power should belong and concern about using the pardon in cases of impeachment.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ffn15">15</a></sup> Both of these issues were settled: The Executive Branch was given the pardon power and did not extend to cases of impeachment.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ffn16">16</a></sup> Based on this history, two scholars posited, “[i]t can be argued that the lack of any other enumerated restriction was intentional.”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ffn17">17</a></sup></p>
      <p>Historical practice also appears to cut against self-pardon opponents. While a President has never self-pardoned, several governors and one mayor have done so.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ffn18">18</a></sup> The pardon practices of state governments have been used to justify certain exercises of the Federal pardon power, most notably the issuance of posthumous pardons.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ffn19">19</a></sup></p>
